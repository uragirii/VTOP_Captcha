# VTOP_Captcha
The new login portal for VIT Chennai contains a different type of Captcha as compared to FFCS. 

I've used similar technique for finding the captcha value. This doesn't uses `opencv` as it is designed for VITask. 

# Modules used
Most of the modules I've used are found in Python only. But 2 modules needs to be installed.
- `selenium` - This is primarily used for getting captcha
- `pillow` - for image manipulation
